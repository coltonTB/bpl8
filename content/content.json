What emerged from this process was a new schematization of the world’s languages, each one framed within a particular problematic, with each of these problematics arrayed in relation to the English language along a spectrum of ease and difficulty. For these engineers, the Hebrew “problem” comprised its right-to-left orientation, with its corresponding “solution” emerging via technical modifications to the “carriage advance” mechanism of the standard single-keyboard apparatus. By comparison, the “problem” with Arabic comprised that of alphabetic variation, with the shape of individual Arabic letters varying depending upon their location within a word.

Because of the specific incongruity the languages’ demands and the machine’s capacities, the typewriter-form could not comfortably translate the Chinese script into a set of simple mechanical adjustments. To encompass Chinese, the development of an altogether different form would be required, one that did not begin with QWERTY as its logico-mechanical point of departure. This inability to encompass Chinese was not, however, interpreted ultimately as a limitation or weakness of the QWERTY typewriter-form, but was rather displaced upon the Chinese language, deployed as incontrovertible proof of the Chinese language’s fundamental incompatibility with the technolinguistic requirements of modernity."},{"body":"In the 1910s, two Chinese students voyaged to the United States. Their dream? To design a typewriter for Chinese, and prove to the world that their language belonged to the modern era.\n\nTHE PUZZLE\nTo design a typewriter for Chinese required engineers and linguists to solve a complex design puzzle: How do you fit thousands of characters on an easy-to-use, desktop device?\n\nTwo inventors vied to solve this puzzle first. Their visions were radically different.\n\nZhou Houkun graduated MIT in 1915, receiving the first Masters degree in Aeronautical Engineering ever awarded in the United States. But his true passion was Chinese language technology.\n\nZhou designed a typewriter based on “common usage characters” — a subset of approximately 3,000 Chinese characters that people used in everyday life. The language’s tens of thousands of other characters were not included.\n\nQi Xuan studied at NYU, and his approach to Chinese typewriting was entirely different. Inspired by the idea of “spelling” in Alphabetic languages, he cut Chinese characters up into modular pieces, which the typist could then use to build up, or “spell,” Chinese characters piece-by-piece.\n\nUltimately, the common usage approach won the day. The prototype by Zhou Houkun was acquired by Commercial Press in Shanghai, China’s most important publisher.\n\nRedesigned by Chinese engineer Shu Zhendong, the “Shu Zhendong Chinese typewriter” became the country’s first mass-manufactured typewriter."},{"title":"Western Typewriter","subtitle":"Subtitle","body":"At the turn of the century, Christopher Latham Sholes’ invention began to circulate the globe, transported and adapted for non-English languages by companies such as Remington, Underwood, and Smith Premier.

Through the years, the Chinese written language encountered presumed alphabetic universalism in the form of Morse Code, Braille, stenography, Linotype, punch cards, word processing, and other systems developed with the Latin alphabet in mind. This book is about those encounters -- in particular thousands of Chinese characters versus the typewriter and its QWERTY keyboard. Thomas Mullaney describes a fascinating series of experiments, prototypes, failures, and successes in the century-long quest for a workable Chinese typewriter. \n\nThe earliest Chinese typewriters, Mullaney tells us, were figments of popular imagination, sensational accounts of twelve-foot keyboards with 5,000 keys. One of the first Chinese typewriters actually constructed was invented by a Christian missionary, who organized characters by common usage (but promoted the less-common characters for \"Jesus\" to the common usage level). Later came typewriters manufactured for use in Chinese offices, and typewriting schools that turned out trained \"typewriter girls\" and \"typewriter boys.\" Still later was the \"Double Pigeon\" typewriter produced by the Shanghai Calculator and Typewriter Factory, the typewriter of choice under Mao. Clerks and secretaries in this era experimented with alternative ways of organizing characters on their tray beds, inventing an arrangement method that was the first instance of \"predictive text.\" \n\nToday, after more than a century of resistance against the alphabetic, not only have Chinese characters prevailed, they form the linguistic substrate of the vibrant world of Chinese information technology.  The Chinese Typewriter, not just an \"object history\" but grappling with broad questions of technological change and global communication, shows how this happened.\n\n_______________\n\nThe Chinese Typewriter is a fascinating and extensive study into the characteristics of the Chinese language.\n- Ai Weiwei\n\nHow to make a typewriter for a language that has a discrete picture for each word? Here's the story of a century of experiments. Fascinating.\n\n- Maxine Hong Kingston, author of The Woman Warrior, China Men, and Tripmaster Monkey \n\nMullaney reveals a topic I have always attempted to investigate through my art. The book is not about the tool itself, but the characteristics of Chinese-writing cultures. It explains what is behind Chinese thinking and its unique working method, and why China is what it is today.\n- Xu Bing, artist; creator of  Book from the Sky and  Square Word Calligraphy\n\nThe Chinese Typewriter is lucidly written and brilliantly conceived. This book will help readers understand and appreciate China, the Chinese language, and writing in general with greater and necessary nuance.\n- Lisa Gitelman, editor of  \"Raw Data\" Is an Oxymoron and author of  Paper Knowledge\n\nThe Chinese Typewriter is a fascinating book: in the light of new developments in computer science, Thomas Mullaney brings us a completely different interpretation of nonalphabetic Chinese and the modern fate of Chinese culture through the historical lens of the Chinese typewriter. This is a rich book that encompasses different resources, historical insights, and intriguing storytelling from long and broad perspectives.\n- Wang Hui, Professor of Literature and History, Tsinghua University; author of  China's Twentieth Century)"},"info":{"title":"Information","subtitle":"How would you design a Chinese typewriter?

The code was designed to handle thirty discrete units: perfect for the twenty-six letters of English, but not for other languages.\n\nIn 1871, telegraphic communication reached China.
